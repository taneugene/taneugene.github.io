Hello! I am an applied microeconomist studying energy, technology, and firms, mostly in developing countries.

My [research](https://taneugene.github.io/research/) uses industrial organization, spatial, and networks tools to study consumer and firm behavior and their implications for designing policies for electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa, the impact of carbon taxes through supply chains and on fossil fuel producers, and methods to estimate the internal production network of a firm.

I am a PhD candidate in the [Sustainable Development Program](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia Universityâ€™s [School of International & Public Affairs](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/) and [the Earth Institute](https://earth.columbia.edu/). I previously did an MeSc from the [Yale School of the Environment](https://environment.yale.edu/), worked as a Data Scientist at the [World Bank](https://www.gfdrr.org/en) and at an education startup, and did a [Junior Fellowship](https://carnegieendowment.org/james-c-gaither-junior-fellows-program) at the [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/?lang=en).
