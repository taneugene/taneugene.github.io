  title={Connection Policy Design for Electricity Access: Lessons from Rwandan Electrification},
  author={Tan, Eugene and Gonzalez Sutil, Gabriel and Mugyenyi, Joel},
  abstract={Sub-Saharan utilities and governments have employed policies to promote electricity access that are distinctive from utilities elsewhere. First, we observe that credit is unusually often paid through consumption tariffs rather than fixed installments. We argue that by affecting prices, it induces substitution from electricity. Even as repayment is decreased, this can counterintuitively increase utility profits, as most Sub-Saharan utilities have consumption tariffs below marginal cost. By reducing enforcement costs, it also allows the utility to give more generous credit. Second, while most utilities set flat-fee connection charges based on an average connection cost, some Sub-Saharan utilities have used distance-based connectioncharges based on a marginal cost logic. We show that distance-based connection charges allow the utility to price discriminate between households with different willingness to pay by creating strategic incentives for electricity adoption. Consider two households some distance from the grid. The first to connect pays more to extend the grid, while the second mover benefits from a lower cost after expansion. The first mover cross-subsidizes the second mover with a positive externality after they adopt. As a result, the utility can lower the second-mover's minimum connection charge and increase equilibrium electricity access. Finally, governments can choose to spatially delineate areas for on-grid and off-grid electricity. This diffuses the spatial extent of electricity coverage that off-grid private companies and the public utility can provide together, but also interacts with distance-based connection charges to We use a case study of Rwanda to study these tradeoffs in connection policies, which does all three. We estimate that Rwandan rural electricity access at the beginning of 2020 would have been substantially lower if they did not use the these connection policies.},

@article{supply_chain_emissions,
  title={Supply Chain Propagation of Carbon Prices},
  author={Tan, Eugene},
  abstract={Production of upstream intermediates emit more carbon, so we should tax them. Meanwhile, theory on industrial policy argues that subsidies should be targeted upstream. What is the right price on dirty, upstream goods? It depends on the social benefits of carbon pricing (the quantity of abated carbon, not just the social cost of carbon) and the social costs of carbon taxes (if they exacerbate intersectoral frictions). I use novel interfirm production network data to quantify carbon leakage, carbon abatement, and `accumulation' downstream through the supply chain. This paper aims to compare these effects. I find that changes in the EU-ETS price propagates through multiple tiers of the supply chain both within the EU and outside of the EU. Along the way, I find that leakage in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme is driven more by export declines rather than import competition, suggesting a larger role for export rebates than import tariffs in carbon border adjustments.

@article{embedded_emissions,
  title={Measuring Embedded Emissions Without Direct Firm Disclosure},
  author={Tan, Eugene},
  abstract={Can we measure embedded emissions without direct firm disclosure? Firm disclosure of scope 3 emissions is difficult because firms typically know only a small fraction of the emissions of their indirect suppliers, as suppliers view their own suppliers and technologies as part of their comparative advantage. We develop an algorithm to estimate intra-facility production from firm inputs and outputs based on graphical matching to technology databases, drawing from an old literature on technology-based models of the firm. We estimate life-cycle emissions from production network data, and show implications for embedded carbon-based policies.},

@article{eroi_oilfields,
  title={Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for Forty Global Oilfields Using a Detailed Engineering-Based Model of Oil Production},
  author={Brandt, Adam R. and Sun, Yuchi and Bharadwaj, Sharad and Livingston, David and Tan, Eugene and Gordon, Deborah},
  abstract={Studies of the energy return on investment (EROI) for oil production generally rely on aggregated statistics for large regions or countries. In order to better understand the drivers of the energy productivity of oil production, we use a novel approach that applies a detailed field-level engineering model of oil and gas production to estimate energy requirements of drilling, producing, processing, and transporting crude oil. We examine 40 global oilfields, utilizing detailed data for each field from hundreds of technical and scientific data sources. Resulting net energy return (NER) ratios for studied oil fields range from ≈2 to ≈100 MJ crude oil produced per MJ of total fuels consumed. External energy return (EER) ratios, which compare energy produced to energy consumed from external sources, exceed 1000:1 for fields that are largely self-sufficient. The lowest energy returns are found to come from thermally-enhanced oil recovery technologies. Results are generally insensitive to reasonable ranges of assumptions explored in sensitivity analysis. Fields with very large associated gas production are sensitive to assumptions about surface fluids processing due to the shifts in energy consumed under different gas treatment configurations. This model does not currently include energy invested in building oilfield capital equipment (e.g., drilling rigs), nor does it include other indirect energy uses such as labor or services.},
